# Description

This repository is a summary of lectures from various programming courses 
and was created in order to systematize the material. 
It contains the most useful and frequently used algorithms. Most of the code is 
written in C++, but Python implementation examples will also be added as we work. 
The repository was written by a student and may contain some flaws. 
I will be glad if you suggest a more efficient implementation of the algorithm 
or point out some errors in the code. 

## About Me

I am Herman Kichenin, computer science student from Canada.                   
In my free time I do sports programming and study algorithms.   
I love to explore and learn new algorithms and programming techniques.
